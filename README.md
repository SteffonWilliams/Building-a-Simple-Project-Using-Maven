# Building-a-Simple-Project-Using-Maven
This simple Java project focused on building a project using Maven. The follwing was done: 
1. Installing MAVEN by executing commands in the Command Line. 
2. Building Java code by executing the command "mvn package" in the Command Line. This command compiled my Java code and packaged my code
in a JAR file within the target directory. 
3. I added JUnit and Joda Time dependencies to the pom.xml file to demonstrate adding dependencies to my project.
